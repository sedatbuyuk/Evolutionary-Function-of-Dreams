# The Evolutionary Function of Dreams: From Symbolic Cognition to Biological Encoding

This repository contains the manuscript and supplementary materials for the research paper titled:  
**"The Evolutionary Function of Dreams: From Symbolic Cognition to Biological Encoding"**  
Authored by **Sedat B端y端k**, 2025.

## Abstract

This study proposes a novel framework in which dreams are understood not as mere cognitive byproducts but as evolutionary tools for internal biological design. Drawing from symbolic cognition theory, shamanic traditions, and neurobiological phenomena such as internal radiation (e.g., biophoton emissions), the paper presents evidence that dreams encode symbolic experiences into biological form through epigenetic mechanisms.

## Core Ideas

- Dreams are not passive but active evolutionary mechanisms.
- Symbolic narratives (e.g., myths) become embedded in biological development via repeated exposure in dreams.
- Internally generated radiation may play a key role in encoding symbolic patterns into gene expression pathways.
- The dream state serves as a feedback loop between cognition and evolution.
